                My name's Hugo. I'm a full-stack developer. Currently, 
                as a student I'm currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in Application Design and Development in Dijon, 
                with a view to training in this field of IT. I'm interested in 💻 new technologies and 👨‍💻 computer science in general. 
                I'm passionate about 🎮 video games and their 🎨 creative fields. I'm curious by nature and 
                I want to progress in IT. I'm always looking to improve in what I do or produce in general,
                as well as being able to work independently and listen to others when I'm working in a team.
