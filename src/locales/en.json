I'm interested in 💻 new technologies and 👨‍💻 computer science in general. I'm passionate about 🎮 video games and their 🎨 creative fields. I'm curious by nature and I want to progress in IT. I'm always looking to improve in what I do or produce in general, as well as being able to work independently and listen to others when I'm working in a team."
